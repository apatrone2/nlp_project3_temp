    "3.\tWe want to explore the syntactic / stylistic patterns of the poem. For this purpose, for each line of poem, write a script that outputs the most frequent tag and the less frequent tag. Save the result in an excel file. Then compute the tag-coherence of the poem. This is computed as the proportion of the most common frequent tag across all lines of the poem for frequent-tags, and the proportion of the most common less-frequent tag across all lines for less frequent tag. In other words, you should provide tag-coherence in two dimensions (less-frequent tag and most frequent tag). Suggest a plot where you display the various tags (less-frequent tag, and another one for most frequent tag). Note that in the case where most frequent or less frequent yields more than one output, this should be taken into account in the calculus of the intersection (common tags across all lines)."

    "6.\tWe would like to compare the phonetic of homonym and that of surrounding terms. For this purpose, use the “Fuzzy” library in python to generate the character string that identifies phonetically similar words (see fuzzy.Soundex (d) statement where d is the length of the generated string, and then use edit distance to compute the phonetic similarity between two words. See an example of implementation at https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/ultimate-guide-to-understand-implement-natural-language-processing-codes-in-python/.  Use the size of “d” open to account for more fine tuned phonetic evaluations. Therefore use the phonetic evaluation to compute the i) the edit distance between homonyms (should follow the order they appear in the document – first homonym and the second closest, then between the second one and the third one, etc..). Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the calculated distances. ii) Repeat the edit distance phonetic calculus when considering the first and last token of each line of poem (excluding stopword).
